This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The project is deployed at https://aakashb.com.np/react-work-assignment/

React Hooks has been used in this project.  Hooks let you do more things with function components. Hooks also make the code more modular and reusable.
Example as below:
 const [count, setCount] = useState(0).

Initially, we have the value of count as counnt= 0.
Now, Update count with setCount(1).
Now count equals to 1 and the component will update.

Github pages was used to deploy the site."gh-pages" dependency was added to package.json.

CI was done by using Travis CI which is an open source platform, travis.yml is added to the root structure of the project.
